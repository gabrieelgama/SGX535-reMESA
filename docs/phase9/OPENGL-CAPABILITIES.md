# OpenGL capability gates (Mesa 25.2.0)

No OpenGL version is currently advertised. OpenGL 3.0 feasibility remains **UNKNOWN**. The first real context remains the implementation priority. This is a capability inventory, not a conformance claim.

Latest context increment: the complete Mesa25.2.0 i386 EGL/GBM/DRI runtime
now reaches the real reMESA constructor on the Mini12. Identity, transport and
diagnostic screen allocation pass; OpenGL admission rejects with ENOTSUP and
missing mask0x1f. Only DRM version queries were permitted; zero SGX submissions.
Restricted fragment UBO0 specialization is implemented as synchronized host
selection of existing constant-color profiles, not GPU uniform execution.
See [the exact trace](OPENGL-CONTEXT-TRACE.md).

| Target | Driver status | New barriers beyond earlier versions |
|---|---|---|
| 2.0 | BLOCKED | General vertex/fragment shaders, textures, blend/stencil, draw buffers and inherited GL functionality |
| 2.1 | BLOCKED | GLSL 1.20, sRGB textures and pixel buffers |
| 3.0 | BLOCKED / feasibility UNKNOWN | GLSL 1.30, integer/float formats, FBOs, texture arrays, transform feedback, multisampling and normative limits |

Mesa-side object/state management and lossless data conversion can be valid emulation. Planned emulation is not implemented support. No software rasterizer or CPU shader execution counts as SGX acceleration.

Mesa 25.2.0 accepts four color attachments in its GL 3.0 gate with an explicit nonconformance comment. reMESA must use the normative eight-attachment requirement, not this shortcut. Geometry shaders first belong to later versions and are not a 3.0 prerequisite.

Normative references: [OpenGL 2.0](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec20.pdf), [OpenGL 2.1](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec21.pdf), [OpenGL 3.0](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec30.pdf). Public specifications are requirements references; no disputed SGX implementation is used.

Restricted vertex increment (2026-10-09): lowered position pass-through NIR and canonical clip-to-window host preparation are offline qualified. This does not establish general hardware vertex shader execution. Disabled blend/depth/stencil and solid/no-cull CSO ownership now exist; Mesa default half-pixel raster semantics remain rejected. No GL version or extension is newly advertised. See the machine-readable inventory for updated per-component evidence.

Framebuffer increment (2026-10-09): the driver now carries explicit load/store
intent and rejects populated-target reuse through the native REPLACE-only path
before dispatch. Diagnostic discard remains explicit. This is a safety contract,
not proof of SGX framebuffer preservation; native load/store behavior and the
required PBE encoding remain UNKNOWN. GPU clear is still BLOCKED because the
only admitted clear is a counted CPU BGRA8 transfer with writer-fence gating.

The pinned Mesa DRI artifact now builds and loads through the real i386 DRIL
entry under QEMU, with invalid-device and missing-artifact rejection covered.
This does not admit a state-tracker OpenGL context: general shader translation,
textures, depth/stencil, framebuffer preservation and truthful GL capabilities
remain missing. No OpenGL version or extension is advertised.

Resolution increment (2026-10-09): backend-limited, aligned transfer storage and
constant-output CPU geometry preparation are qualified through 1920x1080,
including 1280x800. Larger storage is tested through the persistent provider and
kernel memory-service source with injected kernel APIs. This does not change
GPU texture/render-target limits, sampler support or OpenGL admission. Dynamic
PRESERVE/DISCARD observation checks exist, but physical COLOR-load behavior and
larger render-surface command/state remain UNKNOWN.

Current integrated increment: real Gallium transfer callbacks support bounded
CPU raw-texel clears and overlap-safe resource copies across arbitrary admitted
storage sizes. Per-target reservation/publication/retirement gates protect
reuse; native PRESERVE still fails closed. Constant FS admission now accepts
scalar-constant vec4 construction and identity-copy chains only. Fragment
interpolation and coordinate-convention capabilities are disabled. Direct XCB
CPU publication is row-tiled and tested offline through1920x1080. No OpenGL
version, context, GPU sampling or larger GPU surface is established by these
changes. See the current driver-contract qualification receipt.

Admission increment (2026-10-09): actual Gallium sampler views now retain checked
RGBA/BGRA transfer backing with immutable level/layer/swizzle descriptors and
allocation cookies. Standard Mesa view release remains safe after context
destruction. Nonempty sampler/view bindings still reject before dispatch and GPU
sampling caps remain disabled. Recording-backend identity draws with explicit
near/far depth clipping use homogeneous CPU primitive preparation and semantic
packet compaction; production dispatch is unchanged. Neither component supplies
unknown GPU texture or raster encodings.

The exact new i386 frontend was loaded on the Mini12 under the qualified
VERSION-only syscall filter. PCI, DRM transport and diagnostic screen creation
passed; OpenGL admission remained ENOTSUP with mask0x1f. No SGX/memory ioctl or
GL call was issued. A complete baseline profile remains unavailable: restricted
NIR profiles and texture object bookkeeping do not satisfy inherited OpenGL
shader, sampling, raster, render-state and load/store requirements.
